DataFlow is a dependency of the ParallelMergeTree.

You will find out that the ParallelMergeTree has a CMake configuration, the dependencies are:
- DataFlow, a CMake project as well (so you can build with the usual: mkdir build; cd build; ccmake ../; make;  etc.)
- DIY, in inside the ParallelMergeTree project, you can just run ./configure and make, it should create include a lib directory
- idx_restructuring, also inside the ParallelMergeTree project, just make
- MPI, the one on your machine

These dependency are used by the CMake configuration of the ParallelMergeTree project, so if it doesn’t find automatically just set the paths in the ccmake. 

Basically the executable that you want to build is “multi_task_local_compute_test” (so you can just do  "make multi_task_local_compute_test”)
the corresponding source code is a good starting point in utilities/multi_task_local_compute_test.cpp
