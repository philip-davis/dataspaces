BIL, the Block I/O Layer - 07/20/2010
=========


Release Notes:

		- BIL is in beta testing and has only been tested on the Blue Gene/P
			and MAC OS/X architectures.

		- BIL relies on MPI-IO and a installed version of MPI that supports
			this. ROMIO, the most common MPI-IO implementation, can be found
			in MPICH2 and downloaded at 
			http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpich2/.

		- BIL is automatically built with Parallel netCDF support. If you
			do not wish to perform I/O on netCDF files, you may pass the
			--disable-pnetcdf flag to configure.

		- Define the MPICC global variable if you wish to compile with an MPI
			compiler that is not named "mpicc".

		- For installations of MPI or Parallel netCDF that are not found
			under the PATH variable, use the --with-mpi or --with-pnetcdf
			flags to specify the installation directory of these when running
			configure. For example, if pnetcdf.h is located under /usr/local/include,
			use --with-pnetcdf=/usr/local.

		-	For testing BIL on your system or for example code, look at the
			files in the "example" directory. A simple makefile is included
			for building the files. For more information, read the README
			file in the examples directory.
