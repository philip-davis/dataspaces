BIL examples - 05/29/2010
=========


Compiling:

		-	For compilation of examples, type "make". The makefile defaults
			to using mpicc. If this is not your MPI compiler, change the CC
			variable inside the makefile.

		-	If you compiled BIL WITHOUT netCDF support, you must open
			the makefile and edit the DISABLE_NETCDF variable.

Running:

		-	To test BIL with raw files, type "make run_bil_test_raw". This
			will create raw files in your local directory and call mpirun to
			run BIL. If you wish to schedule the job to run with a queueing
			system or wish to store the raw files in another directory, open
			the makefile and change the parameters in the testing section
			of the makefile.

		- To test BIL with netcdf files, you must have the Parallel netCDF
			and regular netCFD libraries installed. Type "make run_bil_test_nc"
			to create the netcdf files and run the tests. For changing any
			parameters, please refer to the instructions on running the raw
			file tests.
