#Instructions on setting up an S3D problem of specific size

1) The main input file is 's3d.in'. Change the numbers starting on the first column in various lines as described below.

2) The No. of grid points in X\Y\Z directions (nx_g\ny_g\nz_g) are specified on lines 8-10 resp. The total grid count = nx_g*ny_g*nz_g.

3) The number of processors in X\Y\Z dirs (npx\npy\npz) are on lines 11-13. Note that nx_g must be divisible by npx and so on. So the total nprocs = npx*npy*npz and number of grid points per proc = (nx_g/npx)*(ny_g/npy)*(nz_g/npz). 

4) For optimal performance with S3D, each of (nx_g/npx) etc. must be ~ 20 but do not go below 12. 

5) The physical size of the domain is specified (in cm) by xmax\ymax\zmax on lines 52-54. You must specify xmax = nx_g*0.004, ymax = ny_g*0.004 and zmax = nz_g*0.004 (the grid resolution is fixed to 0.004 cm and you shouldn't have to change that).

6) The number of time steps is specified on line 19.

7) The 's3d.in' in the git repo is an example of a 48 processor job with 384000 grid points and 20*20*20 grid points per processor running for 20 timesteps. 

8) You shouldn't have to change any other input files.
