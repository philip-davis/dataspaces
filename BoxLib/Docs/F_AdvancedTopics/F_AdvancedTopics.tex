We now enhance our heat equation example from the previous section.
Below is an outline of how we will proceed.  Each of these sections contains an 
accompanying tutorial code that builds upon the previous example.
\begin{itemize}

\item In Section \ref{Sec:Boundary Conditions} we develop the
  capability to handle other (non-periodic) boundary condition types.

\item In Section \ref{Sec:Refinement} we develop the capability to
  have multiple levels of refinement using a fixed, multilevel grid
  structure.

\item In Section \ref{Sec:AMR} we develop the capability to adaptively
  change the multilevel grid structure.

\item In Section \ref{Sec:Linear Solvers} we develop the capability to
  solve the equation implicitly, using the linear solver libraries.

\end{itemize}

\section{Boundary Conditions}\label{Sec:Boundary Conditions}
In order to understand how to implement boundary conditions, we shall
first describe the general principles behind working with boundary
conditions.  The {\tt BoxLib/Tutorials/HeatEquation\_EX2\_F/} tutorial
continues our heat equation example, but now with some non-periodic
boundary condition support.  The boundary condition modules in {\tt
  BoxLib/Src/F\_BaseLib/define\_bc\_tower.f90} and {\tt
  multifab\_physbc.f90} can be used as a springboard for developing
your own customized boundary conditions.

\subsection{General Principles}
The basic idea is that every grid has knowledge of the
boundary condition type at the low and high side edge in each direction.
The ``physical'' boundary condition types supported by default are {\tt INLET}, {\tt OUTLET},
{\tt SYMMETRY}, {\tt SLIP\_WALL}, {\tt NO\_SLIP\_WALL}, and {\tt PERIODIC}.
There is also an {\tt INTERIOR} boundary condition type, which 
will be explained below.  We use an integer mapping that is 
contained in {\tt BoxLib/Src/F\_BaseLib/bc.f90}:
\begin{lstlisting}[backgroundcolor=\color{light-green}]
integer, parameter, public :: PERIODIC     = -1
integer, parameter, public :: INTERIOR     =  0

integer, parameter, public :: INLET        = 11
integer, parameter, public :: OUTLET       = 12
integer, parameter, public :: SYMMETRY     = 13
integer, parameter, public ::    SLIP_WALL = 14
integer, parameter, public :: NO_SLIP_WALL = 15
\end{lstlisting}

{\bf Examples:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Consider grid 1 in Figure \ref{fig:bc_example1}.  The low-x
  boundary condition is {\tt INLET}, and the high-y boundary condition
  is {\tt NO\_SLIP\_WALL}.  The high-x and low-y boundary conditions
  are {\tt INTERIOR}, which means that the ghost cells share the same
  physical space as cells in the valid region of another grid.  Note
  that for grids 6, 7, 10, and 11, the boundary condition type for
  every side is {\tt INTERIOR}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{figure}[tb]

\includegraphics[width=4in]{./F_AdvancedTopics/bc_example1}
\caption{\label{fig:bc_example1}Two-dimensional example with 16 -
  4$^2$grids with {\tt INLET}, {\tt OUTLET}, and {\tt NO\_SLIP\_WALL}
  boundary conditions.  The numbers refer to the grid number.}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item Figure \ref{fig:bc_example2} demonstrates a problem with
  periodicity in the x-direction.  In this case, the low-x boundary
  condition for grid 1 is {\tt PERIODIC}.  Note there are some
  similarities between {\tt PERIODIC} and {\tt INTERIOR} boundary
  conditions when it comes to filling ghost cells in that ghost cell
  values are simply copied in from the valid region of another grid.
  In fact, one can think of {\tt PERIODIC} as just a special type of
  {\tt INTERIOR} boundary condition.  For the other boundary
  conditions types, the user can write custom boundary conditions
  routines to fill ghost cells, which can involve setting ghost cell
  values directly, or using interior points and/or physical boundary
  conditions in some stencil operation.

{\tt PERIODIC} and {\tt NO\_SLIP\_WALL} boundary conditions.

\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item Now, consider an example with refined grids.  Figure
  \ref{fig:bc_example3} contains three grids at the next level of
  refinement.  In this case, for grid 1, all of the boundary condition
  types are {\tt INTERIOR}, even though the neighboring valid region
  data is at a coarser level of refinement.  For grid 2, the low-y
  boundary condition is {\tt NO\_SLIP\_WALL}, and the other three
  walls are {\tt INTERIOR}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation}
Typically, we read in integer values from the inputs file for {\tt
  bc\_x\_lo}, {\tt bc\_x\_hi}, {\tt bc\_y\_lo}, etc., that correspond
to the physical boundary condition types.  We then build a {\tt
  bc\_tower} object which is an array of {\tt bc\_level} objects, one
for each level of refinement.  The {\tt bc\_level} contains several
integer array data structures, as can be seen in {\tt
  BoxLib/Src/F\_BaseLib/define\_bc\_tower.f90}:
\begin{lstlisting}[backgroundcolor=\color{light-green}]
type bc_level

   ! 1st index is the grid number (grid "0" corresponds to the prob domain)
   ! 2nd index is the direction (1=x, 2=y, 3=z)
   ! 3rd index is the side (1=lo, 2=hi)
   ! 4th index is the variable (only assuming 1 variable here)
   integer, pointer :: phys_bc_level_array(:,:,:) => Null()
   integer, pointer ::  adv_bc_level_array(:,:,:,:) => Null()
   integer, pointer ::  ell_bc_level_array(:,:,:,:) => Null()

end type bc_level
\end{lstlisting}
Each level has a {\tt phys\_bc\_level\_array(0:ngrids,dim,2)} array,
where {\tt ngrids} is the number of grids on that level, {\tt dim} is
the dimensionality of the simulation, and the third index refers to
the lower or upper edge of the grid in that coordinate direction.
This stores the {\it physical description} of the boundary type ({\tt
  INLET}, {\tt OUTLET}, etc.), which is independent of the variables
that live on the grid.  The {\tt phys\_bc\_level\_array(0,:,:)} refers
to the entire domain.  If an edge of a grid is not a physical
boundary, then it is set to a default value, typically {\tt INTERIOR}.
These boundary condition types are used to interpret the actual method
to fill the ghost cells for each variable, as described in {\tt
  adv\_bc\_level\_array} and {\tt ell\_bc\_level\_array}.

Whereas {\tt phys\_bc\_level\_array} provides a physical description
of the type of boundary, the array {\tt adv\_bc\_level\_array}
describes the action to be taken (e.g. reflect, extrapolate, etc.) for
each variable when filling physical ghost cells on domain boundaries.
The prefix ``{\tt adv\_}'' is somewhat of a misnomer, as this data
structure was originally intended to tell advection (or hyperbolic)
solvers how to fill ghost cells, but now is generally used to fill
physical domain boundary ghost cells in any instance where the user
needs to set them.  The form of this array is {\tt
  adv\_bc\_level\_array(0:ngrids,dim,2,nvar)} where the additional
component, nvar, allows for different state variable that lives on a
grid to have different boundary condition actions associated with it.
For example, you could have {\tt nvar=1} correspond to the x-velocity,
{\tt nvar=2} correspond to density, and {\tt nvar=3} correspond to
pressure.  In the {\tt BoxLib/Tutorials/HeatEquation\_EX2\_F/}
tutorial, there is only one variable, $\phi$, so obviously {\tt
  nvar=1} shall correspond to $\phi$.  When we build the {\tt
  adv\_bc\_level\_array}, we first set all values to {\tt INTERIOR},
and then overwrite any physical domain boundary condition types, as
given in {\tt phys\_bc\_level\_array}.  The {\tt
  adv\_bc\_level\_array} types supported by default are (as listed in
{\tt BoxLib/Src/F\_BaseLib/bc.f90}):
\begin{lstlisting}[backgroundcolor=\color{light-green}]
integer, parameter, public :: INTERIOR     =  0

integer, parameter, public :: REFLECT_ODD  =  20
integer, parameter, public :: REFLECT_EVEN =  21
integer, parameter, public :: FOEXTRAP     =  22
integer, parameter, public :: EXT_DIR      =  23
integer, parameter, public :: HOEXTRAP     =  24
\end{lstlisting}

To manually fill ghost cells, we call {\tt multifab\_physbc}, passing
in the state multifab along with the {\tt adv\_bc\_level\_array}.  The
subroutines {\tt physbc\_1d/2d/3d} in {\tt
  BoxLib/Src/F\_BaseLib/multifab\_physbc.f90}, indicate how to fill
ghost cells.  For example,
\begin{lstlisting}[backgroundcolor=\color{light-green}]
  subroutine multifab_physbc(s,start_scomp,start_bccomp,ncomp, &
                             the_bc_level,time_in,dx_in, &
                             prob_lo_in,prob_hi_in)

    integer        , intent(in   )           :: start_scomp,start_bccomp
    integer        , intent(in   )           :: ncomp
    type(multifab) , intent(inout)           :: s
    type(bc_level) , intent(in   )           :: the_bc_level
    real(kind=dp_t), intent(in   ), optional :: time_in,dx_in(:)
    real(kind=dp_t), intent(in   ), optional :: prob_lo_in(:),prob_hi_in(:)

    ! Local
    integer                  :: lo(get_dim(s)),hi(get_dim(s))
    integer                  :: i,ng,dm,scomp,bccomp
    real(kind=dp_t)          :: time,dx(get_dim(s))
    real(kind=dp_t)          :: prob_lo(get_dim(s)),prob_hi(get_dim(s))
    real(kind=dp_t), pointer :: sp(:,:,:,:)
    
    ! set optional arguments
    time    = 0.d0
    dx      = 0.d0
    prob_lo = 0.d0
    prob_hi = 0.d0
    if (present(time_in))       time = time_in
    if (present(dx_in))           dx = dx_in
    if (present(prob_lo_in)) prob_lo = prob_lo_in
    if (present(prob_hi_in)) prob_hi = prob_hi_in

    ng = nghost(s)
    dm = get_dim(s)
    
    do i=1,nfabs(s)
       sp => dataptr(s,i)
       lo = lwb(get_box(s,i))
       hi = upb(get_box(s,i))
       select case (dm)
       case (2)
          do scomp=start_scomp,start_scomp+ncomp-1
             bccomp = start_bccomp + scomp - start_scomp
             call physbc_2d(sp(:,:,1,scomp), lo, hi, ng, &
                          the_bc_level%adv_bc_level_array(i,:,:,bccomp), &
                          time, dx, prob_lo, prob_hi)
          end do
...

  subroutine physbc_2d(s,lo,hi,ng,bc,time,dx,prob_lo,prob_hi)

    use bl_constants_module
    use bc_module

    integer        , intent(in   ) :: lo(:),hi(:),ng
    real(kind=dp_t), intent(inout) :: s(lo(1)-ng:,lo(2)-ng:)
    integer        , intent(in   ) :: bc(:,:)
    real(kind=dp_t), intent(in   ) :: time,dx(:),prob_lo(:),prob_hi(:)

    ! Local variables
    integer :: i,j

    !!!!!!!!!!!!!
    ! LO-X SIDE
    !!!!!!!!!!!!!

    if (bc(1,1) .eq. EXT_DIR) then
       ! set all ghost cell values to a prescribed dirichlet
       ! value; in this example, we have chosen 1
       do j = lo(2)-ng, hi(2)+ng
          s(lo(1)-ng:lo(1)-1,j) = 1.d0
       end do
    else if (bc(1,1) .eq. FOEXTRAP) then
       ! set all ghost cell values to first interior value
       do j = lo(2)-ng, hi(2)+ng
          s(lo(1)-ng:lo(1)-1,j) = s(lo(1),j)
       end do
...
\end{lstlisting}

Note that the optional arguments allow for the use of space and/or
time-dependent boundary conditions.

{\tt ell\_bc\_level\_array} is the analog to {\tt
  adv\_bc\_level\_array} for the linear solvers in \BoxLib.  These
will be described in Section \ref{Sec:Linear Solvers}.

\section{Multiple Levels of Refinement}\label{Sec:Refinement}
In the {\tt BoxLib/Tutorials/HeatEquation\_EX3\_F/} tutorial, we have
expanded our example to the cases of multiple levels of refinement,
with the grids fixed in space.  In this example we advance all the
grids with the same time step, and perform synchronization operations
between levels.\\

The big change for this tutorial is that we use a "multilevel layout"
{\tt ml\_layout} rather than a {\tt layout}, and also {\tt multifab
  phi} and {\tt dx} are now {\tt nlevs} sized arrays.  After
initializing or updating $\phi$, we must fill all ghost cell and
synchronize the solution between levels.  After we make the fluxes, we
must synchronize the fluxes to maintain conservation.\\

There are three key subroutines for filling ghost cells and
synchronizing data in multilevel applications.  Each of these involves
a coarse level and a fine level:
\begin{itemize}

\item {\tt ml\_cc\_restriction} sets coarse cell-centered values equal
  to the average of the fine cells covering it.

\item {\tt ml\_edge\_restriction} sets coarse edge-centered values
  (such as fluxes) equal to the average of the fine edges covering it.

\item {\tt multifab\_fill\_ghost\_cells} fills fine ghost cells using
  interpolation from the underlying coarse data.  Note that this
  operation does not affect ghost cells that would be filled by {\tt
    multifab\_fill\_boundary} or {\tt multifab\_physbc}.

\end{itemize}

\section{Adaptive Mesh Refinement}\label{Sec:AMR}
Now fully implemented in {\tt BoxLib/Tutorials/HeatEquation\_EX4\_F/}.
The basic idea is to ``tag'' the cells you with to refine in {\tt
  BoxLib/Src/F\_BaseLim\b/tag\_boxes.f90}.  To write your own
customized tagging criteria, copy {\tt tag\_boxes.f90} into your local
directory and modify it, since this copy will take precedence over the
version in the \BoxLib~source.

There are several new
parameters that can be set via an inputs file:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt amr\_buf\_width}: radius (in cells) of tagged cells in
  addition to those already tagged due to the criteria in {\tt
    tag\_boxes.f90}.
\item {\tt cluster\_minwidth}: any newly created grids must be at
  least this many cells in each direction.
\item {\tt cluster\_blocking\_factor}: any newly created grids must
  have an integer multiple of this many cells in each direction.
\item {\tt cluster\_min\_eff}: This is a real number between 0 and 1
  that controls how tightly the newly created grids match the tagged
  cells.  As this value approaches 1, you will have more, smaller
  grids.  Another way to think of this is that during the grid
  creation process, at least 100$\times${\tt cluster\_min\_eff}
  percent of the cells in each grid at which the grid creation occurs
  must be tagged cells.
\item {\tt regrid\_int}: frequency, in time steps, on when to regrid
  the simulation.
\end{itemize}
It is worth playing around with the inputs files to see what effect
these parameters have on the grid structure.

\section{Linear Solvers}\label{Sec:Linear Solvers}
The tutorial code {\tt BoxLib/Tutorials/HeatEquation\_EX5\_F/}
contains an implicit version of the heat equation example.  Fortran90
\BoxLib\ contains a ``cell-centered'' multigrid solver that solves
linear systems of the form:
\begin{equation}
(\alpha\mathcal{I} - \nabla\cdot\beta\nabla)\phi = \text{RHS},
\end{equation}
where $\alpha, \phi$, and RHS are cell-centered \MultiFab~s, and
$\beta$ is an array of \MultiFab~s that are nodal in exactly one
direction (i.e., one face-centered \MultiFab for each spatial
direction).  The Laplacian-like term in the left-hand-side can be
discretized in several ways.  The simplest discretization option is
similar to a 5-point (7-point in 3D) Laplacian:
\begin{eqnarray}
\nabla\cdot\beta\nabla\phi_{ij} &=&
\frac{1}{\Delta x} \left[\beta_{i+\myhalf,j}\frac{\phi_{i+1,j} - \phi_{ij}}{\Delta x} - \beta_{i-\myhalf,j}\frac{\phi_{ij} - \phi_{i-1,j}}{\Delta x}\right]\nonumber\\
&&+ \frac{1}{\Delta y} \left[\beta_{i,j+\myhalf}\frac{\phi_{i,j+1} - \phi_{ij}}{\Delta y} - \beta_{i,j-\myhalf}\frac{\phi_{ij} - \phi_{i,j-1}}{\Delta y}\right].
\end{eqnarray}
A fully implicit discretization of the heat equation,
\begin{equation}
\frac{\phi^{n+1} - \phi^n}{\Delta t} = \left[\nabla\cdot(\nabla\phi)\right]^{n+1},
\end{equation}
is equivalent to
\begin{equation}
(\mathcal{I} - \Delta t\nabla\cdot\nabla)\phi^{n+1} = \phi^n.
\end{equation}
Thus, we will set $\alpha=1$, each $\beta=\Delta t$, and RHS = $\phi^n$.

\section{Subcycling in Time}\label{Sec:Subcycling}
In {\tt BoxLib/Tutorials/AMR\_Adv\_Diff\_F} we have expanded the
explicit version of the heat equation example in 
{\tt BoxLib/Tutorials/HeatEquation\_EX4\_F/} to include an example of
subcycling in time.  In the previous examples, which did not use
subcycling in time, each level was advanced with the same time step,
which was determined by imposing the CFL criterion at the finest
level.  In the example in {\tt BoxLib/Tutorials/AMR\_Adv\_Diff\_F},
we use both temporal and spatial refinement; 
$\Delta t$ decreases as $\Delta x$ decreases so
that each level is running at a different time step.  For explicit
solution of advection or hyperbolic equations, $\Delta t / \Delta x$
is constant across levels; for explicit solution of parabolic equations, 
$\Delta t / \Delta x^2$ is held constant.  This strategy
requires fewer steps to be taken at all but the finest levels relative
to the non-subcycling algorithm, but requires a more sophisticated
synchronization algorithm between levels.  Overall, the use of
subycling for explicit methods usually reduces runtime despite the
synchronization overhead.

With subycling in time, the advance of each level is called
recursively from coarsest to finest,  with interlevel synchronization 
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:subcycling_algorithm}. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{figure}[tb]
\centering
\includegraphics{./F_AdvancedTopics/subcycling_algorithm}
\caption{\label{fig:subcycling_algorithm} Subcycling algorithm with 3 levels of refinement. 
        $num\_substeps=2$ is assumed here for clarity. }
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%During the single global time step, the algorithm performs
%${(num\_substeps)}^{\ell-1}$ steps at each level $\ell$ according to
%the predefined sequence presented in
%Figure~\ref{fig:subcycling_algorithm}. The main rule is that coarser
%levels are always updated before the finer ones. 
To advance the solution at level $\ell,$ where we assume $0 < \ell < \ell_{max},$
the following steps are taken:
\begin{itemize}
\item Ghost cells at level $\ell$ are filled, either 
using interpolation from level $\ell-1$, physical boundary conditions, or 
copying from other grids at level $\ell$. 
\item Face-based fluxes are computed at level $\ell$ and used to update the solution at level $\ell$.
\item Fluxes are stored in order to correct cells on the coarse side of any
coarse-fine interface.   Level $\ell$ and (the temporal and spatial average of) 
level $\ell+1$ fluxes will be stored and used to correct level $\ell$ cells 
adjacent to the interface of levels $\ell$ and $\ell+1.$   Similarly, both
$\ell-1$ fluxes and (the temporal and spatial average of) level $\ell$ fluxes
will be stored and used to correct level $\ell-1$ cells 
adjacent to the interface of levels $\ell-1$ and $\ell.$ 
\item This procedure is called recursively $num\_substeps$ times for level $\ell+1.$
\item The solution at level $\ell+1$ is averaged down onto level $\ell$.
\end{itemize}
