--------------------------------------------- Function timings.
To use the profiler, set PROFILE=TRUE in your GNUmakefile.
A summary of timings will be written to cout and optionally
a directory named bl_prof will be created with timings for
each processor in nfiles files.

You must at least instrument main.

To instrument regular functions, add BL_PROFILE("class::fname()") to
the top of your function. there can only be one of these per function.

void YourClass::YourFunction() {
  BL_PROFILE("YourClass::YourFunction()");  // this name can be any unique string

  // function code
}


For other timers within an already instrumented function, add:

      BL_PROFILE_VAR("Flaten::FORT_FLATENX()", anyname);  // add this before
        FORT_FLATENX(arg1, arg2);
      BL_PROFILE_VAR_STOP(anyname);   // add this after, using the same name


For main, add these:

int main(...) {

  BoxLib::Initialize(argc,argv);

  BL_PROFILE_VAR("main()", pmain);  // add this

  // code for main

  BL_PROFILE_VAR_STOP(pmain);  // add this
  BL_PROFILE_SET_RUN_TIME(Your_timers_time_for_the_run);  // optional

  BoxLib::Finalize();
}


Profiling macros are empty if profiling is off.


--------------------------------------------- fortran90 f90 interface

fortran90 functions can be profiled, add these functions:

call bl_proffortfuncstart("copyassoc_build")
...
call bl_proffortfuncstop("copyassoc_build")

you will need to add bl_proffortfuncstop calls
before any returns.  the profiling output will
warn of any bl_proffortfuncstart calls that were
not stopped with bl_proffortfuncstop (in debug mode only).
you will need to add bl_proffortfuncstop before any
returns and at the end of the function (or at the
point in the function you want to stop profiling).
for functions with a high number of calls, there is
a lighterweight interface:

call bl_proffortfuncstart_int(n)
...
call bl_proffortfuncstop_int(n)

where 'n' is an integer in the range [1,mFortProfsIntMaxFuncs]
mFortProfsIntMaxFuncs is currently set to 32.  the profiled
function will be named FORTFUNC_n in the profiler output,
unless you rename it with BL_PROFILE_CHANGE_FORT_INT_NAME(fname, int)
where fname is a std::string and the int is the integer 'n'
in the bl_proffortfuncstart_int/bl_proffortfuncstop_int calls.
BL_PROFILE_CHANGE_FORT_INT_NAME should be called in main().




--------------------------------------------- Communications timings.
Timings for communication functions such as ParallelDescriptor::Send(...)
are shown in the regular profiling's function timing section.  BoxLib
can also collect additional information such as point to point
communication timings, amount of data moved, barrier and
reduction wait times, etc.  To use this part of the profiler,
set PROFILE=TRUE and COMM_PROFILE=TRUE in your GNUmakefile.
A database of communication information will be written to
a directory named bl_comm_prof.  The files here must be
postprocessed in a manner similar to plotfiles to extract
useful information.  This is done with the CommProfParser
(AmrPostprocessing/C_Src/CommProfParser).

Some features of the communication profiler:
  local filtering.
  nfiles for data and headers.
  demand driven i/o support.
  named tags.
  named barriers.
  flushing.

instrumentation:

BL_COMM_PROFILE_NAMETAG("LevelAdvance::FillPatchIterator START");
BL_COMM_PROFILE_NAMETAG("LevelAdvance::FillPatchIterator END");

barriers can be named:  ParallelDescriptor::Barrier("CreateDirs");


input:

output:

usage:

overhead:

demand driven i/o support:
  each header file contains seek position information for
  data blocks, barriers, reductions, and named tags and
  minmax times for each data block in order to assist
  reading subsets of the data.


file formats:
  the communication data exists in the directory named
  bl_comm_prof.  header files are named bl_comm_prof_H_0000
  through bl_comm_prof_H_nnnn, where nnnn is nfiles-1.
  data files have the same names except 'D' instead of 'H'.
  the data is in binary.  currently there is no support
  for postprocessing on a machine with a different byte
  ordering from where the data was written.

  header files have the following format:

NProcs  4
CommStatsSize  24
CommProfProc  0  nCommStats  2338513  datafile  bl_comm_prof_D_0000  seekpos  0
bNum  0  "Amr::setRecordGridInfo"  4
bNum  1  "Amr::checkPoint::dir"  1489916
bNum  n  "barrier name"  seekpos
bNum  m  "barrier name"  seekpos
nTag  "STEP 1"  2338512
nTag  "tagname aaa"  seekpos
nTag  "tagname bbb"  seekpos
red  0  2574
red  1  2576
red  n  seekpos
timeMinMax  0.002336025238037109  231.200443983078
nameTagNames  "STEP 1"
nameTagNames  "tagname aaa"
nameTagNames  "tagname bbb"
NProcs  4   # <------------------ a new data block
# rest of data block
# more data blocks


each mpi process writes its own data and data can be
flushed during the run, so there will be multiple
blocks for each process, probably interleaved with
data from other processes.  the commprofparser will
sort these out.
