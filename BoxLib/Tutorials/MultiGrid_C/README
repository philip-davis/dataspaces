This code solves

   a alpha soln - b div (beta grad soln) = rhs,

where a and b are constants, alpha, beta, rhs, and soln are arrays.

To solve the linear system, it can use either the linear solvers in
BoxLib or the Hypre library at LLNL.  

The directory includes a makefile and a sample inputs file.  

To build the code, you need to specify in the makefile the location
where you have placed BoxLib.  To use Hypre, you need to specify the
location of the Hypre library and set USE_HYPRE to TRUE in the
makefile.

The inputs file contains some adjustable parameters.  See the comments
in the file for details.

Plotfiles can be generated by setting the plot_* parameters in the
inputs file.  They can be viewed with amrvis3d (CCSE's native vis /
spreadsheet tool) or with visit.
