This examples solves the advection/diffusion/reaction equations for
several species being advected by a velocity field.   Reaction and diffusion
are optional; in the examples the reaction is just a stub.

It is a BoxLib based code designed to run in parallel using MPI
to distribute grid patches.

The directory Exec/UniformVelocity includes a makefile and a sample inputs file.  
Plotfiles are generated that can be viewed with amrvis2d  
(CCSE's native vis / spreadsheet tool, downloadable separately from ccse.lbl.gov)
or with Visit.
