Chemotaxis
==========

The description of the chemotaxis model presented here follows Hillen
and Painter's "A user's guide to PDE models for chemotaxis",
J. Math. Biol., vol. 58, no. 1, pp. 183-217, 2009.

The general form of the chemotaxis model that we will consider here
is

  u_t = ∇·( D(u) ∇u - A(u) B(v) ∇v ) + f(u), 
  v_t = ∇·( ∇v ) + u g(u) - v

where u is the cell (organism) density and v is the concentration of
the chemical signal.  The minimal model is given by 

  D(u) = 1, A(u) = u, B(v) = Χ, f(u) = 0, and g(u) = 1

so that the resulting system is

  u_t = ∇·( ∇u - Χ u ∇v ), 
  v_t = ∇·( ∇v ) + u - v.

More complicated models are constructed by adding:

1. Signal dependent sensitivity (receptor binding)

   B(v) = Χ / (1 + α v)**2 

2. Density dependent sensitivity (volume-filling)

   A(u) = u (1 - u/γ)

3. Non-linear diffusion 

   D(u) = D u^n

4. Non-linear signal kinetics (saturating chemical production)

   g(u) = 1 / (1 + φ u)

5. Cell growth (logistic growth)

   f(u) = r u (1 - u)


Both the cell density u and chemical concentration v can be zero, and
therefore any high-order finite-volume discretization used must
preserve positivity.  As such, we will use a first-order scheme to
avoid introducing new extrema and/or negative values into the
solution.
