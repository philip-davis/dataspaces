This short program demonstrates the difference that ordering of indices can make in a stencil
computation. 

If you set "oldway" = true then this uses the traditional stencil ordering, with the stencil index last.

If you set "oldway" = false then this uses the new stencil ordering, with the stencil index first.

Build the code, for example, by typing

fort -O3 -ip program.f90 -o nway   (when oldway = .false.)

and

fort -O3 -ip program.f90 -o nway   (when oldway = .true.)


Then run the code with timings by typing

time ./nway

and 

time ./oway
 

This simple test demonstrates roughly a factor of 5 speedup with the new stencil ordering.
