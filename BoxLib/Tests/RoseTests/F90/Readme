This is a collection of simple tests demonstrating possible bugs in
ROSE0.9.5a-without-EDG-20390.  These tests were written when we tried
to compile BoxLib using ROSE's identityTranslator.  More specifically,
we tried to compile BoxLib/Tutorials/HeatEquation_EX1_F/, which uses
BoxLib/Src/F_BaseLib.  

* Test 1: ROSE translates 
     all(pmask .eqv. .false.) 
  into 
     all(pmask .eq. .false.)

* Test 2: ROSE does not like "d%d".

* Test 3: ROSE inserts "PUBLIC" to derived type.

* Test 4: ROSE does not handle 1.e50_8 properly.

* Test 5: ROSE has OpenMP problems.

* Test 6: OpenMP

* Test 7: Namelist and module

* Test 8: Array
