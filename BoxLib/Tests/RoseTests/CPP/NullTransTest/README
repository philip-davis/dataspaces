This test uses the identityTranslator from RoseInstall/bin
to try to translate the BoxLib source.  RoseInstall/bin
must be in your path and BOXLIB_HOME must be either
set in your environment or at the top of the GNUmakefile.


About half of the source code does not translate correctly
using rose-0.9.5a-19322.

The code will compile with these set in the GNUmakefile:

COMP      = g++
FCOMP     = gfortran


To use Rose, set to:

COMP      = rose
FCOMP     = rose
ROSECOMP  = identityTranslator
ROSEFCOMP = identityTranslator
