The original MultiGrid runs I did from which I passed DUMPI trace files to
Joe Kenny was done with an early version of ComparisonTest, not C_CellMG.
ComparisonTest has been changed so much that I fixed up C_CellMG so that
it more-or-less does an equivalent problem.  Not exactly the same, but
close enough to illustrate what we do.

If anyone wants to duplicate exactly the original DUMPI trace files:
