This directory presents a simple example to demonstrate the dataspaces 
location-aware write feature on an infiniband HPC cluster. To enable this
new feature, please configure dataspaces package with the
"--enable-dataspaces-location-aware-write" option.

The example has two applications, a writer and a reader.
Number of writer processes is 64.
Number of reader processes is 32.
Number of DataSpaces server processes is 4.

In this directory, there are two job script files: 
(1) job.dspaces.as_service.sith.pbs runs 64 writer process on 4 compute nodes,
and the 32 reader processes on 2 compute nodes. The server processes run on 1 
separate compute node.
(2) job.dspaces.hybrid.sith.pbs runs the 64 writer processes and server processes on the same 4 compute nodes. On each compute node, 1 server is co-located with
 16 writer process. In this case, writer application processes will write data 
to server running on local compute node. It improves write performance, and
can reduce the amount of network data movement when compared with (1).
