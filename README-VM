# DataSpaces 1.6.1 VM Edition
---
### This code has been modified from the master branch to work on an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS release with software emulated InfiniBand (soft iWARP).
### The soft iWARP code is also enclosed in this repository, under the softIB directory.

- config.h contains a change for InfiniBand wherein "ib0" must be changed to "eth0" on the VM (due to iWARP emulator)
- IMPORTANT: config.h is overwritten every time the configure script is run! make sure that you always edit ib0 to eth0 afterward.
