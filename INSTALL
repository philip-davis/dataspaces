Requirements
============
1. DataSpaces requires MPI. 


Quick Installation Instructions
===============================
The following steps are needed to configure, build and install DataSpaces.

1. Configure
# Examples for the configure command on supported architectures and networks. Please customize it according to your specific system configurations and environments.
# Cray XE and XK series
$ ./configure CC=cc FC=ftn

# Infiniband cluster
$ ./configure CC=mpicc FC=mpif90

# IBM BlueGene/P
$ ./configure CC=mpixlc FC=mpixlf90 CFLAGS="-g -O0 -qarch=450 -qtune=450" --with-dcmf="/bgsys/drivers/ppcfloor"

# IBM BlueGene/Q
$ ./configure CC=/bgsys/drivers/ppcfloor/comm/xl/bin/mpixlc_r FC=/bgsys/drivers/ppcfloor/comm/xl/bin/mpixlf90 CFLAGS="-O0 -g -qlanglvl=extc99 -O3 -qarch=qp -qtune=qp -qfullpath"

2. Some of the useful configure options
 --prefix=/install/path
   Set the directory where DataSpaces will be installed.

 --with-max-num-array-dimension=integer value
   This option is used to configure the maximum number
   of array dimension that can be supported in
   DataSpaces/DIMES. Default value is set as 3. Note:
   the value can not be set larger than 10, or smaller than 3.

 --enable-dimes
   Build DataSpaces with DIstributed MEmory Space (DIMES) support.
   DIMES feature uses local RDMA memory buffers across application processes to build
   a virtual shared data space in-situ, which can be queried and directly accessed by 
   other applications in a data coupling workflow. Currently this feature is only 
   supported on Cray Gemini networks, on IBM BG/P and BG/Q systems. 

 --with-dimes-rdma-buffer-size=integer value for megabytes
   This option specifies the maximum amount of RDMA memory buffer that
   can be used by DIMES in each application process. DIMES RDMA memory buffer is used
   to locally cache the data written by dimes_put(), and is also used by
   dimes_get() to fetch data in remote memory buffer. Must be used with
   --enable-dimes option. Default value is set as 64MB.

--with-build-for-stampede=integer
  User set this value to 1 in order to configure and compile DataSpaces on Stampede cluster.

--with-infiniband-msg-queue-size=integer value
  User can use this option to change the size of the messaging queue on DataSpaces servers.
  If you receive errors stating the messaging queue is full. You should use this option to
  increase the size of the messaging queue.



   For applications using DIMES, dimes_put_sync_all() or dimes_put_sync_group()
   API functions (see dimes_interface.h for detailed documentation) should be
   called periodically to free data objects cached in DIMES. Where there is no
   sufficient memory space, dimes_put()/dimes_get() would fail and return errors. 

3. Build & Install 
# Under project top directory
$ make
$ make install
